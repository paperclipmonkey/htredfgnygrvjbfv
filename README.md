# Michael Waterworth loqbox challenge

Completed on 20th April 2020.
Making a 90s design hurts! Remove /* 90s design */ for a cleaner 2020 design.

I heavily relied on Vue for the scaffolding, and Vue Material for UI components.

All state is in the VueX store, allowing easy backing to a local database if required.

Hope you like it!
